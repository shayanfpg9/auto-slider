# awesome slider

## Introduction

sometimes you need a dynamic slider but your users can't work with admin panel or back-end programming language ,
you only need a slider when you add file in the alias folder a new slide made.
so I made this slider with language format rtl and lrt.

<!-- >if you enjoy to know something more please check **[here for ltr](./rtl/pooster/readme.md)** or **[here for rtl](./rtl/pooster/readme.md)** -->

## Adding slide

add file into posters folder with this name format
`yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm-yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm`

the first date is the start time of the event and the second date is the end time of the event

you can add perfix of suffix too
